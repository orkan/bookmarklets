* To install node packages **directly** from GitHub:

  ```bash
  npm install git+https://github.com/MattMcAdams/CSS-Boilerplate.git
  npm install github:orkan/utilsjs.git#3.0.0
  ```

* What's the correct way to set a base REM value in CSS?

  You need to make your `html` font-size to 16px as your base font-size and then use rem with the rest. Rem sizes the element relative only to html while em sizes relatively to its nearest parent.

* GitHub 404 "File not found" on `node_modules` folder.

  Github pages uses a version of Jekyll that ignores `node_modules` folder by default. To fix it, create an empty `~/.nojekyll` text file.
